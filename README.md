# Citizens' Financial Inc. Banking System

## Project Description

Citizens' Financial Inc. Banking System is a text-based banking application developed in Python by a group of students—myself, Abhijeet Rajhans, and Armaan Shaikh—during the latter part of our 11th grade. This project represents one of our first collaborative programming projects, utilizing the knowledge we gained in Python so far. It simulates fundamental banking operations such as account creation, login, money transfer, loan processing, and account management. The application provides a command-line user interface (CUI) for users to interact with a fictional bank system, handling various tasks similar to those performed at an ATM or through online banking.

## Features

- **Account Creation (Sign Up)**: Users can create new bank accounts with unique card numbers and PINs.
- **Login System**: Secure login using card number and PIN, with CAPTCHA verification to prevent automated access.
- **Account Recovery**: Retrieve forgotten account details by verifying email and card number.
- **PIN and Email Change**: Update account PIN or email address securely.
- **Card Blocking/Unblocking**: Users can block or unblock their cards in case of loss or theft.
- **Money Transfer**: Transfer funds to other users within the banking system.
- **Loan Processing**: Apply for different types of loans with varying interest rates and terms.
- **Account Balance Management**: Deposit and withdraw funds, with real-time balance updates.
- **Data Security**: Simulated security features like CAPTCHA and data validation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Text-based menus and prompts guide users through various banking operations.

## Skills Gained

While developing this project, the following skills and concepts were gained:

- **Python Programming**: Enhanced understanding of Python syntax, data structures, and standard libraries.
- **Control Flow Management**: Implemented loops, conditional statements, and exception handling to control program flow.
- **Data Structures**: Utilized dictionaries and lists to store and manage user data effectively.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensured robustness by validating user inputs and handling incorrect entries.
- **String Manipulation**: Formatted strings for display, parsed user input, and constructed card numbers.
- **Time Module**: Used `time.sleep()` to create delays and simulate processing times.
- **Random Module**: Generated random numbers and CAPTCHA codes for security features.
- **Copy Module**: Deep copied data structures to prevent unintended mutations.
- **ASCII Art and Text Formatting**: Created an engaging user interface using multi-line strings and text art.
- **Problem-Solving**: Designed algorithms to handle banking operations and user interactions.

## How to Run the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Download the Project Files**: Download the project files from the GitHub repository.

3. **Locate the Script**: Navigate to the directory where the `citizens_financial.py` file is located.

4. **Run the Script**: Open a command prompt or terminal window in that directory and execute the script by typing `python banking_system.py`.
